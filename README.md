This is my old and simple Java game that I created back when I was in middle or high school (I don't really remember) for my bonus programming classes.

This game is a simple old-school game where you fly a little spaceship and shoot other ships.

I post this game for a little reminder of "good old times" and a quick reminder of the Java language for me and others.

PS: If you don't have a text editor or programming platforms like VS or IntelliJ IDEA, here is a link on how to run this game using the terminal:
